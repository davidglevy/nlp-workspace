# Terraform Snippets

This is a collection of folders (not modules)
where I can add extensions to the base terraform
template which are quickly deployed and tested without
needing to spin up an entire workspace.

Once I get better at building modules, this is also likely a good way to
encapsulate chunks of code and infrastrucutre for pipelines.
